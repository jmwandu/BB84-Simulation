# BB84-Protocol Simulation
The BB84-Protocol is a form of quantum key distribution that can be implemented
to produce a secure channel for communication of information. The purpose of
this project is to explore this protocol by producing a simulation of the first
7 steps of the protocol.  
  
If you want to run this program yourself, do the following in order:  
1.) Download and install Python3.5  
2.) Clone this repository to your local machine  
3.) Navigate to your local git repository of through the command line  
4.) To run the program, execute the following command:  
&emsp;&emsp;`python3 main.py 0`  
5.) Follow the on-screen instructions to operate the program  
  
If you want to run many simulations of the program, do the following in order:  
1.) Create a program that can compile and execute this program with the
following command:  
&emsp;&emsp;`python3 main.py 1 [bit_size]`  
You must replace [bit_size] with a positive integer that represents the number
of bits you would like the simulation to start with.  
2.) Have your program execute this program as many times as needed and record
the results
